India is regarded as the country of orchards and farmers. Around 50% of the population of our country relies on agriculture and related activities in one or the other wayto support their livelihood (while 22% solely on agriculture). Agriculture plays an important role by contributing 16% to the countryâ€™s total GDP. Therefore, agricultural demands should be thoroughly analyzed and managed as their wastage use would affect future needs. Agricultural sector requires a lot of irrigational water. Water supply to the crop fields should be made judicially, as less water leads to crop crash, whereas abundant water supply can even destroy them. Good farming methods can help farmers overcome this problem. Several methods of irrigation have been experimented and adapted to result in minimum wastage of water such as Ditch irrigation, Terraced irrigation, Drip irrigation, Sprinkler System and Rotary System. The most effective among these being drip irrigation, as in this method of irrigation; water is supplied very close to the roots of the plant drop by drop. Loss of water by evaporation and runoff is minimized to a great extent in this method
